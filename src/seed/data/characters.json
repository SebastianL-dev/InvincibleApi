      "Markus Sebastian \"Mark\" Grayson is the titular protagonist of the series of the same name. A Viltrumite-Human hybrid, he is the superhero known as Invincible, the son of Nolan and Debbie Grayson, the paternal older half-brother of Oliver Grayson II and the maternal grandson of Oliver. He is also the boyfriend of Eve Wilkins/Atom Eve.",
      "Mark gained his powers at the age of 17 and began his superhero journey under the mentorship of his father. After a brief stint with Teen Team, he allied with Atom Eve, the second incarnation of the Guardians of the Globe, and Cecil Stedman of the Global Defense Agency to protect Earth from a wide range of threats. As his duties grew, Mark also took it upon himself to confront the looming danger of the Viltrum Empire, striving to safeguard not just Earth, but the galaxy itself."
